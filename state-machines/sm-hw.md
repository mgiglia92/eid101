### Fix the bug in the state transition diagram example of a long button press: 

    Remember, the bug was that if we continued holding down the button after the first long press, a second long press would be detected 

    Redraw the state transition diagram for the long button press but now with your fix included 

    Edit the example code such that your changes in the state transition diagram are reflected 

    Re-write the state transition nested if statements as a switch:case structure 

### Draw the State transition diagram for the multiple timing system: 

    Draw the state transition diagram for the multiple timing system. Remember each system is isolated from the others!  

    Think of 2 examples where using a multiple timing system would allow you to solve a problem requiring a sort of parallel processing that using delay() or while() loops would prevent proper execution 

### Finish the angular velocity bonus from Controls – 2: 

    Using the single timing system, calculate the approximate angular velocity using the single timing system to execute when the calculations happen 

    You’ll probably need some extra variables to be able to approximate the angular velocity
