# Engineering Design Process Activity 

## Objective (High-Level Problem Statement):  
- Design, Build and Procure materials/tools to build a rubber band powered car. 

## Criteria:  
- Rubber band car must travel 3’and stop in a pre-defined box 
- Rubber band car must be capable of “locking” while the rubber band is charged before starting motion. Pulling the locking mechanism will release it and cause the car to propel itself forward

## Constraints: 

- **NO 3D printing**; Lasercutting of the allowed materials permitted but labs may not be open during class!
- Allowed materials: Cardboard, cardstock, dowels, straws, rubber-bands, hot-glue (limited to 3 sticks per team), duct tape (2' per team)
- Other materials must require permission from instructor before use 
- The only allowed **METALLIC** objects are **MACHINE SCREWS** and **NUTS**

## Deliverables:  
- A new document written that has the following. Don't forget to state who you worked with on this activity and put a relevant heading on the document.
- Three potential solutions with hand-sketches
    - An Engineering Decision Matrix ranking the solutions and selection for prototype 
- Two required sub-problems that need to be solved
    - A short discussion about why these are valid sub-problems, what is the NEED?
    - A short discussion of the brainstorming process for each sub problem
- A .zip (or .tar) file containing .step files of all the parts of your vehicle modelled in CAD. 
    - A picture of your final car should be in this archive file as well 
- A video of your car successfully/unsuccessfully completing the task (Locking mechanism, stopping in the box) 

## MISC Rules: 
- Anytime rubber band has stored potential energy, ALL students in the area MUST be wearing goggles. Ask TAs/Mike for goggles if not available. 

## Reccomendations
- Spend at least the first hour in class brainstorming/researching the overall prototype, completing the engineering decision matrix, defining important sub-problems, and research/brainstorm solutions to those sub-problems
- Spend the second hour prototyping the important mechanisms of the car
