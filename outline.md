# EID 101 Outline

## Week 1
+ Introduction to course (layout of OS)
+ HW: Mechanically Assemble Robot

## Week 2
+ C/C++ Speed Run
+ HW: Build and run HelloWorld.cpp file on pico_w

## Week 3
+ Guided Electrical assembly
+ HW: Choose 3 simple software challenges and complete

## Week 4
+ Sensors speed run
+ HW: Choose 3 sensor challenges and complete

## Week 5
+ Functional Block Diagrams and State Machines
+ HW: Design 2 algorithms, 1 using FBD, other using StateMachine

## Week 6
+ Electronics lesson? Protoboard prototyping? PCB design?
+ HW: Draw an electronics block diagram for the robot

## Week 7
+ Introduction to final project, engineering design process, engineering decision matrix, break into teams of 3. Project must push the boundaries of what you already know 
    + For example: Choose a new sensor to add to the robot. Build a driver to use the new sensor. Design a mount for the new sensor and implement an algorithm to use that sensor

+ HW: Generate 3 final project proposals and populate an engineering decision matrix. Prepare a small 1 page document describing the proposal and desired goals for your project!

## Week 8
+ Build a Gaant chart for the rest of the semester outlining the tasks that need to be completed and what tasks they depend on being completed.
