# Team # - Team Name, Final Report

## Project Outline
EID-101 section B was tasked with augmenting the design of a differential drive robot to complete various tasks such as:
1. Listing of the mile stones

## Project Solution
To complete project the following robot was made: It features ... for ...
and ... 


## Project Timeline
To tackle the problem the team approached in the following way... Gaant Chart, delegation of tasks, sub problem definitions

# Milestones

### Mechanical
#### Line sensor mount
The line sensor mount is crucial to the execution of line following. Things like ... matter in such a way so the robot would be capable of following the black line. The following were some design considerations and testing outcomes. The final mount is **picture** and it (worked, didn't work well) because.
#### Ping-pong ball launching mechanism
One task at hand was ... to do so we designed... The following were potential designs. We chose ... because ... Here is the final design. See **[video-name]** for a working video.

#### Optional: Ping pong ball retrieval mechanism

### Electrical
#### Custom IR sensor array

#### Final electrical schematic

### Algorithimic
#### Subroutines
The following subroutines were designed to make coding easier, as well as making logical flow more repeatable. Here are some subroutines we designed.

#### Robot Orientation Control
We made a subroutine for this! Here is the diagram. And discussion about how it works in plain language.

#### Robot Linear Movement Control
We made a subroutine for this! 

#### Black Line following Control
We made a state machine for this!

#### Junction Detection
We made a state machine for this!
 
#### Obstacle Detection
#### Optional: Object recognition

### Software
#### Explanation of using-robot-examples
#### Custom IR Sensor Array Firmware
To make use of the IR sensor array modular, and simple we created a firmware library for the sensor. See **firmware-code.h/.cpp** for the code. 

#### State Machine(s)

### Management
#### Problem Definitions/Decision Matrix/Gannt Chart
The following were the specific problems we defined to be solved formally during the project development process.

#### BOM

#### Reflection
How did the process go? What could go better? How could it have gone better?

#### Design Journal
See **journal.md** for our weekly design journal
